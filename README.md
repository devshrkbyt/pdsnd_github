Project 2 Bikeshare Database

In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answered interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.I also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
